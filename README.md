###📌 About

The Mobile Sales Data Analysis project is an end-to-end data analytics case study designed to transform raw mobile sales data into meaningful business insights.
The project follows a real-world analytics workflow involving data cleaning in Excel, structured analysis using SQL, and interactive dashboard creation in Power BI.

The dataset includes historical mobile sales transactions with information related to brands, models, pricing, sales quantity, categories, and sales timelines.
By applying SQL queries and visual analytics, this project helps uncover sales trends, performance drivers, and customer purchasing patterns.

###🎯 Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:
- To clean and standardize raw mobile sales data for analysis
- To analyze total revenue, total sales quantity, and average sales metrics
- To identify top-performing mobile brands and models
- To analyze sales trends across time periods
- To support business-level decision making through dashboards


###📊 Key KPIs
- Total Revenue
- Total Mobile Units Sold
- Total Sales Transactions
- Average Sales per Day
- Top Performing Mobile Brand / Model


###🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of mobile sales records that were originally provided in raw Excel format and later structured for analysis.
Main data elements include:
- Mobile brand and model details
- Sales quantity and pricing information
